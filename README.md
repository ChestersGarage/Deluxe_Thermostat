Deluxe_Thermostat
=================

An intelligent thermostat, using a graphic LCD I pulled out of an old data tape library.

UNFINISHED CODE

Hardware:
* DS18B20 or LM335 for the inside temperature (uncomment only one 'define' below)
* Outside temperature and humidity via DHT22 (actually a RHT03)
* U8GLIB LCD library
* DS1307 RTC
